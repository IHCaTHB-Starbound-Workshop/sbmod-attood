Adds NEW new personalities, some goofy some srs.

Works with any modded race that uses the default humanoid AND armor frame files, instead of adding its own.

Characters generated with this mod will lose limbs if you uninstall this mod. Use with care, lest you have to starcheat them back into existence.
